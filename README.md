# PVHS-APCSP2022-ProjectPortfolio
I replicated the app "Wordle" for my APCSP 2022 Project section portfolio. It's important to note that since I was using Code.org to make the application, there is no HTML/CSS file to pair with the JavaScript file. Will work on the HTML/CSS file soon.

Additionally, I included a video demonstration of the code in Code.org, showing the UI of the app. I got a 5 on the AP Exam because of this Project Portfolio I submitted.
